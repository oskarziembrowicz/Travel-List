<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

There are many ways to make a list of things to pack for a trip. Some people use plain pen and paper, others use a notepad on one of their devices, some maybe even have a dedicated app for making a list. However it would be fun to have an application specifically for making a list of things to pack for your travels - something that is nic to use and is suited thematically.

This project was done as a part of React.js course in order to improve my skills and experiment with different features. It served its purpose and now it shows some of the skills I have learned.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

1. To create your first list just start adding some things.

2. To add an element to your list, just type the item name and select the number of items. After that choose **ADD** or press _Enter_.

3. When you click the checkbox next to an item it will be marked as packed.

4. You can press **X** on an existing item to remove it from the list completely.

5. The item list can be sorted by input order, description, or packed status.

6. The text on the bottom of the page shows your progress in packing.

7. When you're done with packing, click **CLEAR LIST** to remove all items
